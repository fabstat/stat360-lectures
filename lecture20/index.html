	    <h3>Introduction to Statistical Inference</h3>
	    <p>In the previous chapter, we <i>knew the population parameters</i> and used them to say something about the probability of getting the random sample we got given these known parameters.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">However, knowing the population parameters <i>a priori</i> is not something that happens in reality.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Instead, we know statistics of our random sample and we want to use those statistics to infer our population parameters.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Recall that these parameters are quantities such as: mean, variance, proportions, etc. These quantities define a distribution.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">So if we are careful and make a good estimation of the population parameters given our random sample, then we can use the distribution we found to solve further problems about that population!</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>As in several fields, there are usually two methods to approach problems: the classical method and the method that was invented later after people sat and thought some more.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">In statistics, the latter one is called the Bayesian method and it does not invalidate the former classical method. It simply requires more "machinery" and it is more complicated to learn and apply.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">We will focus on the classical method, which is still quite applicable, useful and easier to understand.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Inference can be split into: estimation and hypothesis testing.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">You can read about the differences between the two in nuanced examples found in most statistics textbooks, but they are both about letting us infer from what population our random sample came from or didn't come from.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">We will focus on estimation.</p>
	    <small class="fragment">This is our last topic :(. I encourage you to learn about hypothesis testing and Bayesian methods on your own, or by taking future classes. By the way, consider taking more stats classes! You are well prepared for: STAT 423/523 and STAT 443 both offered next fall ;).</small>

	    <h3>Classical Methods of Estimation</h3>
	    <p>A statistic $T = \mathscr{t}(X_1, \dots, X_n)$, that is used to estimate the value of the population parameter $\theta$ is called an <b>estimator</b> of $\theta$. An observed value of the statistic: $t = \mathscr{t}(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, is called an <b>estimate</b> of $\theta$.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Example: as we saw in chapter 8, given that the sampling distribution of the mean is normal in the limit, then maybe the sample mean is a good estimate for the population mean and as such the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is an estimator for the population parameter.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">However, we must be careful because we don't really know the population and we want to make sure that we are not introducing biases or inconsistencies present in some estimators.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Unbiased Estimator</h4>
	    <p>Definition: An estimator $T$ is said to be an <b>unbiased estimator</b> of a parameter $\theta$ if $E(T) = \theta$.</p>
	      <p>Otherwise, we call $T$ is a <b>biased estimator</b> of $\theta$.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">As before, we can "create" populations, draw samples, and come up with a theory for what makes a good estimator, such as unbiasedness.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4> Bias</h4>
	    <img src="img/bias.png" width="700px">
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Example</h4>
	    <p>Let's show that $S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2$ is an unbiased estimator for the variance $\sigma^2$ of a distribution.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">This can be done more easily by using another way of expressing $S^2$ seen in lecture 16:</p>
	    <p class="fragment"> $$S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n\bar{X}^2}{n-1}.$$</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    $$E(S^2) = E\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n\bar{X}^2}{n-1}\right)$$
	    <br>
	    <span class="fragment">$$=\frac{1}{n-1}\left(E\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\right) - E\left(n\bar{X}^2\right)\right)$$</span>
	    <br>
	    <span class="fragment">$$=\frac{1}{n-1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i^2) - nE(\bar{X}^2)\right).$$</span>
	    <p class="fragment">Also, recall that $Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2$ $\Rightarrow E(X^2) = Var(X) + (E(X))^2$.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>So ...</p>
	    <span class="fragment">$$E(S^2) = \frac{1}{n-1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma^2 + \mu^2) - n\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{n} + \mu^2\right)\right)$$</span>
	    <br>
	    <span class="fragment">$$ = \frac{1}{n-1}\left(n\sigma^2 + n\mu^2 - \sigma^2 - n\mu^2\right)$$</span>
	    <br>
	    <span class="fragment">$$ = \frac{1}{n-1}\left(n - 1\right)\sigma^2 = \sigma^2.$$</span>
	  </section>

	    <h3>Does Variance Play a Role?</h3>
	    <p class="fragment">Say that we have two different unbiased estimators $T_1$ and $T_2$ for the parameter $\theta$. Which one should we use?</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Answer: choose the one with the minimum variance.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Role of Variance</h4>
	    <img src="img/variance.png" width="500px">
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Definition: Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ from a distribution $f(x; \theta)$.
	      An estimator $T^*$ of $\theta$ is called a <b>minimum variance unbiased estimator</b> (MVUE) of $\theta$ if:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li class="fragment">$T^*$ is unbiased for $\theta$, and </li>
	      <li class="fragment"> for any other unbiased estimator $T$ of $\theta$, $Var(T^*) \leq Var(T)$.</li>
	      </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Questions</h3>
	    Consider a random sample of size $n$ from $f(x; \theta)$, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ and the trimmed mean introduced in chapter 1 (that is the mean with outliers chopped off), denoted $\tilde{X}$:
	    <ol>
	      <li class="fragment">Is the trimmed mean an unbiased estimation for any distribution? Justify your answer.</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Considering a distribution for which both $\bar{X}$ and $\tilde{X}$ are unbiased estimators, which one is MVUE?</li>
	    </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Biased may not imply bad estimator</h4>
	    <img src="img/mvue.png" width="700px">

	<section>
	<section>
	  <h3>The Standard Error</h3>
	  <p>The standard error of an estimator $T$ is its stardard deviation: $\sigma_T = \sqrt{Var(T)}$.</p>
	  <p class="fragment">It is the magnitude of a typical or representative deviation between an estimate and the value of the parameter $\theta$ being estimated.</p>
	  <p class="fragment">If the population standard deviation is unknown, but can be estimated, then the estimated standard error $\hat{\sigma}_T = s_T$ can be reported instead.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h4>Example</h4>
	  Given a normal distribution the best estimator for $\mu$ is $\bar{X}$. Let our sample size be $n = 20$. If we know that the standard deviation is 1.5, say, then $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sigma/\sqrt{n} = 1.5/\sqrt{20} = 0.335$.
	  <p class="fragment">If we don't know $\sigma$, then we can calculate the standard deviation of the sample and use that instead.</p>
	  </section>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <section data-background-image="img/" data-background-opacity=".2">
	    <h3>Interval Estimation</h3>
	    Even if we are careful to come up with a good estimator, we are unlikely to estimate the true parameter exactly.
	    <p class="fragment">However, we could be pretty "confident" that the true parameter falls within a specific interval.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">An interval estimate of a population parameter $\theta$ is an interval of the form $\hat{\theta}_L < \theta < \hat{\theta}_U$.</p>																	      <p class="fragment">$\hat{\theta}_L, \hat{\theta}_U$ are statistics of a particular sample based following its sampling distribution.</p>
																	      </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Confidence Interval</h4>
	    Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ from a distribution of $X$, and let $\hat{\theta}_L$
and $\hat{\theta}_U$ be sample statistics such that $\hat{\theta}_L \leq \hat{\theta}_U$. Let $\theta$ be a parameter of the distribution of $X$. The random interval $[\hat{\theta}_L, \hat{\theta}_U]$ is called a confidence interval for the parameter $\theta$ with
confidence level $1 − \alpha$ (or $100\%(1 − \alpha)$) if
$$P(\hat{\theta}_L \leq \theta \leq \hat{\theta}_U) = 1 - \alpha.$$
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    Typical confidence coefficients are 0.90, 0.95, and 0.99, with corresponding confidence levels 90%, 95%, and 99%. For example, upon calculating a confidence interval for a mean with a confidence level of, say 95%, we can say:

<p class="fragment">"We can be $95\%$ confident that the population mean falls between $L$ and $U$."</p>

<p class="fragment">As should agree with our intuition, the greater the confidence level, the more confident we can be that the confidence interval contains the actual population parameter.</p>

	    A random sample of 126 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes in downtown Cairo had an average blood lead level concentration of $29.2 \mu g/dl$.

	    <h3>CLT Consequences</h3>
	    If $\bar{x}$ is used to estimate $\mu$, then we can be $100(1-\alpha)\% $ confident that the error will not exceed $z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
	    <p class="fragment">Also, we can be $100(1-\alpha)\% $ confident that the error will not exceed $e$ when the sample size is $n = \left(\frac{z_{\alpha/2}\sigma}{e}\right)^2$.</p>

	    <p class="fragment">Assuming that response times are still normally distributed with $\sigma = 25$, what sample size is necessary to ensure that the resulting $95\%$ C.I. has a width of (at most) 10?</p>

	    <h3>One Sided Confidence Bounds on $\mu$, $\sigma^2$ Known</h3>
	    <p> If $\bar{X}$ is the mean of a random sample of size $n$ from a population with variance $\sigma^2$, the one-sided $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence bounds for $\mu$ are given by:</p>

	      <li class="fragment">upper one-sided bound: $\bar{x}+z_{\alpha}\sigma/\sqrt{n}$</li>
