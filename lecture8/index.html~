	    <h4>Multiplication Rule</h4>
	    <p>We use the multiplication rule whenever we have multiple "moving parts" but they combine to form one outcome.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">For example, you are going to a party and have narrowed down your clothing to 4 shirts, 3 pants, 2 pairs of shoes, and 2 hats. You can only wear one of each to the party. How many different ensembles can you create?</p>

	  <h4>Multiplication Rule</h4>
	  Let's see...
	  <ol>
	    <li class="fragment">With the fedora:
	      <ol>
		<li class="fragment">you can wear any of the shirts, say you pick the black one. With the black shirt...</li>
		<li class="fragment">pants, say you pick the green one. With the green one...</li>
		<li class="fragment">and pairs of shoes, say you pick your cool boots. With the boots...</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li class="fragment">With the bonnet, you can wear any of the shirts, pants and pairs of shoes</li>

	    If an operation can be performed in <span class="fragment highlight-red">$n_1$ ways</span>, and if for each of these a second operation can be performed in <span class="fragment highlight-red">$n_2$ ways</span>,
	    and for each of the first two a third operation can be performed in <span class="fragment highlight-red">$n_3$ ways</span>, and so forth, then the sequence of $k$
	    operations can be performed in <span class="fragment highlight-red">$n_1n_2 \dots n_k$ ways</span>.

	    <h4>Permutations</h4>
	    <p>We care about permutations when we are concerned about the order of our sample or subsample.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">For example, that T/F quantum physics quiz I gave you yesterday in which you completely guessed the answers to four distinct questions.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">We figured out via the multiplication rule that there were 16 different ways to guess...that is</p>
	    <p class="fragment"> 16 different permutations of 4 T's and F's.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Permutations</h4>
	    <p>Picture yourself holding an urn containing two marbles: a <span class="fragment highlight-green">green</span> and a <span class="fragment highlight-red">red</span>.</p>
	    <ul>
	    <li class="fragment">It is random-guesses quiz time. Instructions: for each question draw a marble from your bag.</li>
	    <li class="fragment">If it is <span class="fragment highlight-green">green</span>, answer <span class="fragment highlight-green">T</span> for that question. If it is <span class="fragment highlight-red">red</span>, answer <span class="fragment highlight-red">F</span> for that question.</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Put the marble back in the bag, move on to the next question.</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Since you always replace the marble, each question can have one of two answers!</li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background-image="img/marbles.jpg" data-background-opacity=".1">
	    <h4>Permutations</h4>
	    <p>As a teacher though I had a different problem when I was making your quiz..."do I pick the entanglement question to be the first or the last? what about the particle spin question?!"</p>
	     <ol>
	    <li class="fragment">It is random-making quiz time. Instructions: Place 4 labeled marbles $\{a, b, c, d\}$ in a bag.</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Draw one out - say it is $c$, this will be the first question. Don't replace it, a quiz with repeat questions is boring!</li>
	    </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background-image="img/moremarbles.jpg" data-background-opacity=".2">
	    <ol start="3">
	      <li class="fragment">Now there are 3 marbles in the bag, draw one - say it is $a$, this will be the second question. Don't replace it!</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Now there are 2 marbles in the bag, draw one...</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Now there is 1 marble in the bag, draw it. Done, we have a quiz ordering, say - $cadb$.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ol start="6">
	     <li class="fragment">That is, I had 4 choices for the first questions, 3 for the second, 2 for the third and 1 for the fourth by sampling distinct objects without replacement.</li>
	     <li class="fragment">Factorial definition: $n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1)$ with $0! = 1$</li>
	    </ol>
	    <p class="fragment">How many passwords of length 5 can you make using the letters of the alphabet, if:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="fragment">each letter must be unique?</li>
	      <li class="fragment">each letter can be repeated?</li>
	      </ul>
	    </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Permutations</h4>
	    <p>Another idea we should be aware of when dealing with permutations is non uniqueness, such as permuting the letters of the word "statistics".</p>
	    <p class="fragment">This is a different case then the previous ones, since if we were to put labeled marbles in a bag, there would be one for $s_1$, one for $s_2$, one for $s_3$, ... that is, the bag would have all the repeats as if they were distinct.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">However, when we draw a marble labeled $s_2$, we smudge out the subscript and treat it like an indistinguishable $s$.</p>
	    
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>That is, the anagram $s_1s_3s_2t_3a_1c_1i_2t_1i_1t_2$ is indistinguishable from the anagram $s_3s_1s_2t_2a_1c_1i_1t_1i_2t_3$.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Both spell out "ssstacitit".</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Any ideas how we would count all the permutations for anagrams of the word "statistics"?</p>
	    <img class="fragment" src="img/anagram.jpg" width="200px">
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Idea:</h4>
	    <ol>
	      <li class="fragment">Treat all letters as unique: $s_1 \neq s_2 \neq s_3$ and so on for the others. That is, think of statistics having 10 unique letters and solve the old problem of counting all the permutations: 10!</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Counted by those 10! permutations are the permutations of the $s$ letters amongst each other, 3! of them. However we don't care about the order of the $s$'s in the anagram. So we undo the counting of permuted $s$'s by dividing: 10!/3!</li>
	    </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ol start="3">
	      <li>Do this for all repeated letters and get the following count: $$\frac{10!}{3!3!2!}$$</li>
	    </ol>
	    <div class="fragment">

	    <h4>Circles</h4>
	    Circular arragements are special:
	    <img src="img/circles.png" width="1400px">
	    <p class="fragment">If you want to arrange $n$ objects in a circle, then there are $(n-1)!$ ways to do it. This is because you can rotate the circle $n$ times and it is still the same circle.</p>
	  </section>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <section>
	    <h4>Combinations</h4>
	    <p>Combinations are like permutations when order does not matter. The question it answers is: "In how many ways can I make a subset of the elements of a given set?"</p>
	    <p class="fragment">It is like you have a bag with $n$ marbles and you want to draw $r$ of them to put in another bag.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">$${n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

	    <h4>Probability of an Event</h4>
	    <p>Informally, the probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1 such that:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>If the number is close to 0, then the event is not likely;</li>
	      <li>If the number is close to 1, then the event is very likely;</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p class="fragment"> Question: Discuss examples of events that have $P=0$ (practically impossible) and events that have $P=1$ (definitely will happen as far as we can understand reality).</p>
	  </section>
	  <section  data-background-image="img/facecards.jpg" data-background-opacity=".1">
	    <h4>Relative Frequencies</h4>
	    <p>We assign the probability number via the ratio between the number of ways the event can happen and the total size of the sample space.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">That is, let $A$ be the event we are interested in (say drawing a Jack, a Queen and a King from a deck of 52 shuffled cards) and let $S$ denote the sample space (all possible shufflings of 52 cards), then:</p>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background-image="img/facecards.jpg" data-background-opacity=".1">
	    <p>$$P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$  - where $P(.)$ denotes "the probability of" and $n(.)$ denotes "number of points in the set."</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Question: What is the probability of drawing a Jack, a Queen and a King from any suit (order does not matter) from a shuffled deck of 52 cards?</p>
